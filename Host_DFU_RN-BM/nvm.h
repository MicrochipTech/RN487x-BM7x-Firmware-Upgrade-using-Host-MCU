 *
 * Description:     Programs size characters from the source buffer to

 *
 * PreCondition:    None
 *
 * Inputs:          address:  Destination address to start writing from.
 *                  data:  Location of data to write.
 *                  size:  Number of bytes to write.
 *                  pagebuff:   Ram buffer to preserve 1 page worth of data
 *
 * Output:          '0' if operation completed successfully.

 * Example:         NVMProgram((void*) 0xBD000000, (const void*) 0xA0000000, 1024, (void *) 0xA0002000)

 *
 * Description:     The smallest block of data that can be programmed in

 *                  be erased is selected using NVMADDR. The lower bytes of
