  Ethernet Library Interface Legacy Definition

  Summary:
    This file contains older Application Program Interface (API) definitions  for
    the Ethernet peripheral library.
    The functions in this file are obsolete and not maintained anymore.
    Any new project should use the API in peripheral/eth.h

  Description:
    This library provides a low-level abstraction of the Ethernet module
    on Microchip PIC32MX family microcontrollers with a convenient C language
    interface.  It can be used to simplify low-level access to the module
    without the necessity of interacting directly with the module's registers,
    thus hiding differences from one microcontroller variant to another.

  Summary:

  Description:
    This function adds the specified number of transmit/receive descriptors to
    the pool of descriptors.  These descriptors are used whenever a new
    transmission or a reception is initiated.  The needed memory per descriptor
    is returned by EthDescriptorsGetSize.   Descriptors can be freed with

  Precondition:

  Description:
    This function tries to remove the specified number of descriptors from the
    pool of transmit/receive descriptors.  These descriptors that are NOT used
    at the time of call can be freed (i.e. the TX descriptors not queued for a
    transmission or the not busy RX descriptors).

  Precondition:

  Parameters:
    nDescriptors    - Number of descriptors to be removed

    ETH_RES_OK              - Success

    ETH_RES_PACKET_QUEUED   - The packet is in the receiving queue/
                              There are packets in the receiving queue

    ETH_RES_NO_PACKET       - No such packet in the receiving queue/
                              No packets available in the receiving queue

  Example:
    <code>
    ethRes = EthRxAckPacket(pRxPkt, NULL);
    if ( ethRes != ETH_RES_OK )
    {
        // Handle packet not acknowledged
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Any received packet has to be acknowledged, otherwise the Ethernet library will run
    out of descriptors.

    ackFnc is just a helper that allows the application to call an acknowledge
    function for each received buffer in turn.
