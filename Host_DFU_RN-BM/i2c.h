  I2C Library Interface Definition

  Summary:
    This file contains the Application Program Interface (API) definition  for
    the I2C peripheral library.

  Description:
    This library provides a low-level abstraction of the I2C (Inter-Integrated
    Circuit) module on Microchip PIC32MX family microcontrollers with a
    convenient C language interface.  It can be used to simplify low-level
    access to the module without the necessity of interacting directly with the
    module's registers, thus hiding differences from one microcontroller
    variant to another.

  Function:
    void I2CEnable( I2C_MODULE id, BOOL enable )

  Summary:
    This is a routine to enable or disable the given I2C module.

  Description:
    This routine enables or disables the given I2C module.

  Precondition:
    The module should be appropriately configured (using I2CConfigure and
    I2CSetFrequency, and possibly I2CSetSlaveAddress) before being enabled.

  Parameters:
    id      - Identifies the desired I2C module.

    enable  - Determines if the module is to be enabled or disabled.
              * If TRUE, enables the I2C module
              * If FALSE, disables the I2C module

  Returns:
    None.

  Summary:
    This is a routine to configure the I2C module.

  Description:
    This routine allows the caller to configure various features of the I2C
    module for desired operation.

  Precondition:

  Parameters:
    id      - Identifies the desired I2C module.

  Summary:
    This is a routine to set the I2C module's desired SCL clock frequency.

  Description:
    This routine allows the caller to set the desired clock frequency for the
    I2C module's SCL line.

  Precondition:
    The source clock's frequency must be operating at the frequency passed in
    "sourceClock" parameter.

  Parameters:
    id          - Identifies the desired I2C module.

    sourceClock - Frequency (Hz) of the source clock being provided to the
                  I2C module.

    i2cClock    - Desired frequency of the I2C SCL clock line.

  Returns:
    Actual frequency used.

  Example:

    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Actual frequency selected may be slightly different than frequency
    requested due to truncation error.  Actual frequency observed on the SCL
    line may be lower due to clock stretching.

  Summary:
    This is a routine to set the value and mode of the slave address(es) in
    Slave mode.

  Description:
    This routine sets the slave address and size (7-or-10 bits) to which the
    module will respond.  It also sets an optional "ignore" mask, allowing the
    module to ignore bits within the address and thus respond to multiple slave
    addresses as well as how reserved addresses are handled.

  Precondition:

  Parameters:
    id      - Identifies the desired I2C module

    address - The 7- or 10-bit slave address to which the module will respond.
              (The address should be right-aligned in the 16-bit parameter,
              without any read/write bit in the 0 position.)

    mask    - This parameter identifies bits in the address that are "don't-
              care" bits.  These bits will be ignored when attempting to match
              the address, effectively allowing the module to recognize
              multiple slave addresses.  (To match an address exactly, this
              parameter must be zero (0).)

    flags   - This parameter is a bit-wise OR of the values in the
              I2C_ADDRESS_MODE enumeration.  These enumeration flags can be
              used to select the addressing mode (7-or-10 bits) and define how
              reserved addresses are handled.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    I2CSetSlaveAddress(I2C1, MY_SLAVE_ADDRESS, 0, I2C_USE_10BIT_ADDRESS);
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Some modules may not support all addressing modes or the mask feature.  It
    is safe to pass a zero (0) value for these features if they are not needed.
    If they are not available, the value passed for these features will be
    ignored.

  Description:
    This routine checks to see if the I2C bus is currently idle or if there is
    some activity currently taking place.

  Precondition:

  Parameters:

    * TRUE    - If an external master is requesting data (slave read/transmit)
    * FALSE   - If an external master is sending data (slave write/receive)

  Example:
    <code>
    if (I2CSlaveDataReadRequested(I2C1))
    {
        if (I2CTransmitterIsReady(I2C1))
        {
            result = I2CSendByte(I2C1, slaveTxData);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        slaveRxData = I2CGetByte(I2C1);
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    None.

/*******************************************************************************
  Function:
    void I2CSlaveClockHold ( I2C_MODULE id )

  Summary:
    This is a routine to hold the SCL clock line low.

  Description:
    This routine allows an I2C slave to stretch the SCL clock line,
    holding it low to throttle data transfer from a master transmitter.

  Precondition:
    The module must have been configured appropriately and enabled, and a
    transfer must have been previously started by an exteral master.

  Parameters:
    id      - Identifies the desired I2C module.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    I2CSlaveClockHold(I2C1);
    </code>

  Remarks:
    This routine will cause the SCL line to be forced low, after the current
    byte has been fully received.

/*******************************************************************************
  Function:
    void I2CSlaveClockRelease ( I2C_MODULE id )

  Summary:
    This is a routine to release a previously held SCL clock line.

  Description:
    This routine allows a slave receiver to release a previously held SCL clock
    line, allowing it to go high and allowing data transfer to continue.

  Precondition:
    The module must have been configured appropriately and enabled, and a
    transfer must have been previously started by an external master, and the
    SCL clock line should have been previously held (forced low) by the I2C
    module.

  Parameters:
    id      - Identifies the desired I2C module.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    I2CSlaveClockRelease(I2C1);
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Calling this routine when the clock has not been held will not cause any
    problems.

  Function:
    I2C_STATUS I2CGetStatus ( I2C_MODULE id )

  Summary:
    This is a routine to provide the current status of the I2C module.

  Description:
    This routine provides a bitmask of the current status flags for the I2C
    module.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    id      - Identifies the desired I2C module.

  Returns:
    The return value is a bitmask generated by a bit-wise OR of the I2C_STATUS
    flags that are currently set.

  Example:
    <code>
    status = I2CGetStatus(I2C1);
    if(I2C_ARBITRATION_LOSS & status)
    {
        // Handle arbitration loss
        //...

/*******************************************************************************
  Function:
    void I2CClearStatus ( I2C_MODULE id, I2C_STATUS status )

  Summary:
    This is a routine to clear the specified I2C module status conditions.

  Description:
    This routine clears (if possible) the specified status conditions in the
    I2C module.

  Precondition:
    The I2C module must be enabled.

  Parameters:
    id      - Identifies the desired I2C module.

    status  - A bit-wise OR of the I2C_STATUS flags to be cleared.

  Returns:

  Example:
    <code>
    status = I2CGetStatus(I2C1);
    if(I2C_ARBITRATION_LOSS & status)
    {

        //...
        I2CClearStatus(I2C1, I2C_ARBITRATION_LOSS);
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Some status conditions are automatically cleared by hardware and it is not
    necessary for software to clear them.
