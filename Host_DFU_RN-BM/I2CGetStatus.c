  Function:
    I2C_STATUS I2CGetStatus ( I2C_MODULE id )

  Summary:
    Routine to provide the current status of the I2C module

  Description:
    This routine provides a bitmask of the current status values for the I2C
    module.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    id      - Identifies the desired I2C module

  Returns:
    The return value is a bitmask generated by a bit-wise OR of the I2C_STATUS
    values that are currently set.

  Example:
    <code>
    status = I2CGetStatus(I2C1);
    if(I2C_ARBITRATION_LOSS & status)
    {
        // Handle arbitration loss
        //...
        I2CClearStatus(I2C1, I2C_ARBITRATION_LOSS);
    }
    </code>

    control = i2cRegisters->I2CxCON;
    
    // Condition the "Start" flag so it does not get set until
    // the "Start" (or "Repeated Start") signal is complete.

    {

    // the "Stop" signal is complete.
